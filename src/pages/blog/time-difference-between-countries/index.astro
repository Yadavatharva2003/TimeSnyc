        <h1>Time Difference Between Countries: How to Calculate It Accurately</h1>
        <p class="muted">
          A practical explanation of how time differences work between countries
          and how to calculate them correctly without confusion.
        </p>

        <!-- INTRO -->
        <section id="intro">
          <p>
            Knowing the time difference between countries is essential for
            scheduling meetings, coordinating work, booking travel, and staying
            connected with people around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            While it may seem as simple as adding or subtracting hours, time
            difference calculation is affected by time zones, daylight saving
            time, and regional rules. This is why people often get it wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            This guide explains how time differences between countries really
            work and how you can calculate them accurately every time.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHAT IS -->
        <section id="what-is">
          <h2>What Is the Time Difference Between Countries?</h2>

          <p>
            The time difference between countries refers to the number of hours
            and minutes separating their local times. This difference exists
            because the Earth is divided into multiple time zones.
          </p>

          <p>
            Each time zone is defined as an offset from Coordinated Universal
            Time (UTC). For example, India follows UTC+5:30, while Japan follows
            UTC+9.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- WHY CHANGES -->
        <section id="why-changes">
          <h2>Why Time Difference Is Not Always Constant</h2>

          <p>
            Many people assume that the time difference between two countries
            never changes. In reality, it can shift several times a year.
          </p>

          <p>
            This happens because some countries observe daylight saving time
            while others do not. When one country moves its clocks and the other
            stays the same, the time difference changes.
          </p>
        </section>

        <!-- DST -->
        <section id="dst-impact">
          <h2>How Daylight Saving Time Affects Time Difference</h2>

          <p>
            Daylight Saving Time (DST) temporarily shifts local time forward or
            backward, usually by one hour. Different countries start and end
            DST on different dates.
          </p>

          <p>
            As a result, the time difference between two countries can change
            even if neither country has officially changed its standard time
            zone.
          </p>

          <p>
            This is why DST-aware tools are critical for accurate calculations.

        <!-- HOW TO CALC -->
        <section id="how-to-calc">
          <h2>How to Calculate Time Difference Between Countries</h2>

          <p>
            The most reliable method is to compare both countries using UTC as
            the reference point.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Find each country’s current UTC offset</li>
            <li>Account for daylight saving time if applicable</li>
            <li>Subtract one offset from the other</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            Instead of doing this manually, using a
            <a href="/time-difference/">Time Difference & Work Hours</a>
            tool ensures accuracy and saves time.

        <!-- COMMON MISTAKES -->
        <section id="common-mistakes">
          <h2>Common Mistakes People Make</h2>

          <p>
            Time difference errors often come from assumptions and outdated
            information.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>Assuming time difference never changes</li>
            <li>Ignoring daylight saving time</li>
            <li>Using country-level time for multi-zone countries</li>
            <li>Relying on memory instead of tools</li>
          </ul>

        <!-- TOOLS -->
        <section id="tools">
          <h2>Best Tools for Checking Time Difference</h2>

          <p>
            The safest way to check time difference between countries is to use
            tools designed specifically for global time coordination.
          </p>

          <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

          <p>
            Time difference between countries is not just a number—it is a
            dynamic relationship shaped by time zones and daylight saving rules.
          </p>

          <p>
            By understanding how it works and using accurate, DST-aware tools,
            you can avoid mistakes and coordinate across borders with
            confidence.
